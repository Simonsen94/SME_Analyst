## How is GA4 different from UA?

One of the key features of GA4 is its focus on cross-device and cross-platform measurement. GA4 allows businesses to track customer interactions across all of their devices and platforms, including web, mobile, and offline. This is a significant improvement over UA, which was limited to tracking web-based interactions.

Another major advantage of GA4 is its integration with Google's machine learning capabilities. GA4 uses machine learning to automatically identify and classify user behavior, allowing businesses to gain insights and make better data-driven decisions.

Another key feature of GA4 is its ability to track the customer journey from start to finish. With GA4, businesses can track the entire customer journey, from the initial awareness phase to the conversion phase. This is a major improvement over UA, which was limited to tracking the conversion phase only.

One of the main reasons businesses should consider migrating to GA4 is that it is the future of web analytics. Google has announced that UA will be sunsetted in the near future, and all businesses will be required to migrate to GA4. Therefore, it is important for businesses to start planning their migration now to ensure a smooth transition.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, Google Analytics 4 is the next generation of web analytics and offers significant improvements over Universal Analytics. It is able to track cross-device and cross-platform interactions, integrates with machine learning, and tracks the entire customer journey. Businesses should consider migrating to GA4 to take advantage of these improvements and to prepare for the sunsetting of Universal Analytics.

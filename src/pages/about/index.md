### Help SMEs in the digital economy

Ecommerce accounts for 14.6% of global retail spending, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up 90% of global businesses\[1]. However, only a small percentage of SMEs that invest in ecommerce capabilities see growth from it. This is a paradox that needs to be solved. Therefore, there is a need to create more knowledge about how SMEs can grow through ecommerce and improve their chances of success in the online market.

### Provide access to h﻿igh quality research

I believe that making high-quality research available to the public is vital for driving innovation and improving the quality of communities, products and services. Providing access to the latest knowledge and findings within ecommerce and web analytics, I aim to help individuals and organizations outside of academia to stay informed and make informed decisions. I believe that making research publicly available is an important way to contribute to the greater good and make a positive impact on society. Ultimately, my goal is to use my expertise to make a meaningful difference in the world and help others to do the same.

### Strengthen data democracy

Data democracy refers to a philosophy in which data is made widely and easily accessible to all members of an organization or community. Data democracy empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions, collaborate more effectively, and drive innovation by providing access to data for all members of a community or organization. By giving everyone access to data, organizations can tap into the collective knowledge and expertise of their team and make better use of their data assets to drive business value. Therefore it is my goal to contribute with knowledge that fosters data democracy.

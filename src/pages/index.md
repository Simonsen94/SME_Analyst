    Welcome to the SME Analyst, where small businesses can unlock the power of
    digital strategy and data analytics to make better-informed decisions to
    grow revenue and profitability.
description: I have helped some of the biggest companies and brands within
  pharmaceutical, telco, retail, and insurance realize their ambitious digital
  growth plans. I am specialized in digital transformation consulting and in
  creating data-driven insights that drive change for my clients. Clients choose
  me as their transformation partner because I produce clear and measurable
  commercial results, and because they see that I help them improve â€“ internally
  as well as externally. I have the expertise that they miss, help them
  accelerate development, quickly reach their goal, and ensure that they get the
  expected result once they launch.
